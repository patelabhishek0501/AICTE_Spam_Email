# P3-Spam-Mail-Classification-by-NLP-and-ML

<h1>📧 Email Spam Classification Application</h1>

This project is an **Email Spam Classification Application** built using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The application allows users to input email content and predicts whether it is a **Spam** email or **Not Spam** using a trained model.

The project includes:
- A machine learning model trained on a dataset of spam and ham emails.
- A user-friendly web interface built with **Streamlit**.
